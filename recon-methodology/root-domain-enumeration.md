## Methods

### 1. WhoisXMLAPI

(reverse WHOIS) Visit [https://tools.whoisxmlapi.com/reverse-whois-search](https://tools.whoisxmlapi.com/reverse-whois-search) . Searching with the root domain name like **dell.com** will give you a list of all the associated domains.

[**Crunchbase**](https://www.crunchbase.com/) is another great alternative for finding acquisitions but requires a paid subscription to view all the acquisitions. The trial version allows viewing some of the acquisitions.
